            <h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

            <h3>Q: Will deleting data in-app also delete my cloud backups?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> No. Cloud backups are stored in your Google Drive and must be deleted separately from Google Drive.</p>

            <h3>Q: Can I recover my data after deletion?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> No. Data deletion is permanent and cannot be undone. If you have cloud backups and haven't deleted them, you can restore from those backups.</p>

            <h3>Q: What happens if I just uninstall the app?</h3>

            <p><strong>A:</strong> EZer is a local-first app. We don't store your financial data on our servers. All your data is stored locally on your device or in your personal Google Drive (if you enabled cloud backup).</p>

            <h3>Q: How do I export my data before deleting?</h3>
            <p><strong>A:</strong> Before deleting, go to <strong>Settings ‚Üí Data & Export</strong>. Export your data in CSV, JSON, Excel, or PDF format. Save the exported files to your device.</p>
